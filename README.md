Process Boardex files to get a relevant firm-level dataset.

## Manager-level dataset overview
- Level of aggregation: (Year x Company ID)
- We start with a (Year x Company ID x Director) - level dataset, then we aggregate across directors to get a (Year x Company ID) - level dataset.

### Categories of variables
- Initial identifiers: variables that identify the observation, specifically year and company.
- Quantitative variables in the following categories are aggregated by taking the **mean** across directors for each (Year x Company ID) pair. NaN values occur when every director in that (Year x Company ID) pair has a NaN value.
  - Characteristics of Roles
  - Director Experience
  - Compensation Ratios
  - Director Count Totals
  - Compensation
  - Education
- Categorical variables in the following categories are aggregated by taking shares of counts across directors for each (Year x Company ID) pair. For example, the % of male and female directors in a particular (year, company).
  - Director Experience - Gender
  - Director Experience - Nationality Mix
- CEO and CFO-specific variables in the following categories answer questions like 'What's the compensation of the CEO/CFO?'. In a few cases, there are 2 CEOs or 2 CFOs in one (company, year). For now, we choose the first one that appears in the table.
  - CEO/CFO - Compensation Ratios
  - CEO/CFO - Education
- Firm identifiers: variables that provide details on the company. They are added on by merging on Company ID.
